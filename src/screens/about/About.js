                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>I am passionate about applying simple yet effective algorithms to solve real-world problems. With over 7 years of experience
        as a Software Engineer at leading companies such as Micro Focus, Dell, SAP, Fraunhofer IVI, and currently at 1&1, I have honed my skills
        in building scalable and efficient solutions. My specialization in Distributed Systems Engineering, backed by a Masterâ€™s degree from TU
        Dresden, has been a transformative experience that enables me to approach complex problems with a large-scale mindset.</p>

                <p>My primary focus is on developing robust distributed systems that ensure seamless scalability and resilience. I thrive on 
            challenging work and never hesitate to learn new technologies and methodologies. I enjoy being involved in all aspects of the software
                development lifecycle, from development and testing to CI/CD, ensuring that the solutions I build are both efficient and reliable.</p>
